Two-Body Point Absorber (RM3)
----------------------------------
This section describes the application of the WEC-Sim code to model the Reference Model 3 (RM3) two-body point absorber WEC. 
This example application is provided in the WEC-Sim code release in the ``$Source/tutorials`` directory.

Device Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RM3 two-body point absorber WEC has been characterized both numerically and experimentally as a result of the DOE-funded `Reference Model Project <http://energy.sandia.gov/rmp>`_. 
The RM3 is a two-body point absorber consisting of a float and a reaction plate. Full-scale dimensions of the RM3 and its mass properties are shown below.

WEC-Sim Model Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Below is an overview of the files required to run the RM3 simulation in WEC-Sim. For the RM3 WEC, there are two corresponding geometry files: ``float.stl`` and ``plate.stl``. In addition to the required files listed below, users may supply a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` file for post-processing results once the WEC-Sim run is complete. 

==================   =============================  =============================
**File Type**        **File Name**                  **Directory**
Input File           ``wecSimInputFile.m``          ``/tutorials/rm3/``
Simulink Model       ``rm3.slx``   		    ``/tutorials/rm3/``
Hydrodynamic Data    ``rm3.h5``    	            ``/tutorials/rm3/hydroData/``
Geometry Files       ``float.stl`` & ``plate.stl``  ``/tutorials/rm3/geometry/`` 
==================   =============================  =============================

Run Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Step 1: WEC-Sim Pre-Processing**

Hydrodynamic data for each RM3 body must be parsed into a HDF5 file using the `BEMIO <http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#bemio>`_ hydrodynamic data format. The RM3 HDF5 file (``rm3.h5``) was created based on a WAMIT run of the RM3 geometry. The RM3 WAMIT ``rm3.out`` file and the BEMIO ``readWAMIT.py`` script were used to generate the HDF5 are included in the ``/hydroData`` directory.


**Step 2: Build WEC-Sim model in Simulink**

The WEC-Sim Simulink model is created by dragging and dropping blocks from the *WEC-Sim Library* into the ``rm3.slx`` file. 

* Place two **Rigid Body** blocks from the *WEC-Sim Library* in the Simulink model file, one for each RM3 rigid body.

* Double click on the **Rigid Body** block, and rename each instance of the body. The first body must be called ``body(1)``, and the second body should be called ``body(2)``.

   :width: 600pt


* Place the **Global Reference Frame** from the *WEC-Sim Library* in the Simulink model file. The global reference frame acts as the seabed.

.. figure:: _static/RM3_WECSim_GlobalRef.jpg
   :width: 600pt


* Place the **Floating (3DOF)** block to connect the plate to the seabed. This constrains the plate to move in 3DOF relative to the **Global Reference Frame**. 

* Place the **Translational PTO** block to connect the float to the spar. This constrains the float to move in heave relative to the spar, and allows definition of PTO damping. 

.. figure:: _static/RM3_WECSim.JPG
   :width: 600pt

.. Note::

	When setting up a WEC-Sim model, it is very important to note the base and follower frames.


**Step 3: Write WEC-Sim input file**

The WEC-Sim input file defines simulation parameters, body properties, joints, and mooring for the RM3 model. The ``wecSimInputFile.m`` for the RM3 is provided in the RM3 case directory, and shown below.

*wecSimInputFile for RM3*

.. literalinclude:: RM3wecSimInputFile.m
   :language: matlab
      

**Step 4: Execute WEC-Sim**

To execute the WEC-Sim code for the RM3 tutorial, type ``wecSim`` into the MATLAB Command Window. Below is a figure showing the final RM3 Simulink model and the WEC-Sim GUI during the simulation. For more information on using WEC-Sim to model the RM3 device, refer to :cite:`ruehl_preliminary_2014`.

.. figure:: _static/RM3_WECSim_GUI.JPG
   :width: 600pt

*Output and Post-processing*

The RM3 example includes a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` which plots RM3 forces and responses. This file can be modified by users for post-processing. Additionally, once the WEC-Sim run is complete, the WEC-Sim results are saved to the **output** variable in the MATLAB workspace.


*Running Different Wave Cases*

The input file for the RM3 tutorial includes several different wave cases: 

* noWaveCIC - no wave with convolution integral calculation
* regularCIC - regular waves with convolution integral calculation
* irregular - irregular waves using a Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum with convolution integral calculation
* irregular - irregular waves using a Bretschneider Spectrum with state space calculation
* irregularImport - irregular waves using a user-defined spectrum
* userDefined - user-defined time-series

.. Note::

	If state space is used (``simu.ssCalc=1``), the user needs to make sure the state space hydrodynamic coefficients are included in the ``rm3.h5`` file. 

  
Oscillating Surge WEC (OSWEC)
----------------------------------
This section describes the application of the WEC-Sim code to model the Oscillating Surge WEC (OSWEC). 
This example application is provided in the WEC-Sim code release in the ``$Source/tutorials`` directory.


Device Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The OSWEC was selected because its design is fundamentally different from the RM3. This is critical because WECs span an extensive design space, and it is important to model devices in WEC-Sim that operate under different principles.  The OSWEC is fixed to the ground and has a flap that is connected through a hinge to the base that restricts the flap in order to pitch about the hinge. The full-scale dimensions of the OSWEC and the mass properties are shown in the figure and table below.

Below is an overview of the files required to run the OSWEC simulation in WEC-Sim. For the OSWEC, there are two corresponding geometry files: ``flap.stl`` and ``base.stl``. In addition to the required files listed below, users may supply a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` file for post-processing results once the WEC-Sim run is complete.
